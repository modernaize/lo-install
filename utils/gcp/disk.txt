A (very) short introduction to Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims
Kubernetes provides an API to separate storage from computation, i.e., a pod can perform computations while the files in use are stored on a separate resource. The API introduces 2 types of resources:
PersistentVolumes are used to define a storage volume in the system, but their lifecycle is independant of the ones of the pods that use them. PersistentVolumes are Volume plugins and the API supports a large variety of implementation, including NFS, Glusterfs, CephFS, as well as cloud-providers such as GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, AzureFile and AzureDisk, amongst others.
PersistentVolumeClaims are requests emitted by pods to obtain a volume. Once obtained, the volume is mounted on a specific path in the pod, while providing an abstraction to the underlying storage system. A claim may specify a storageClassName attribute to obtain a PersistentVolume that satisfies the specific needs of the pod.

Note that if no PersistentVolume matches the storageClassName attribute of the requesting PersistentVolumeClaim, the cluster will attempt to create a new one dynamically.
